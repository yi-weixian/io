        <ul><li>The most challenged one is Git, it is new for me. So I do a lot of search on it.</li></ul>
        <ul><li>In this assignment, I know how to create a good structure with using tags, and I know how to add imagins on the web.</li></ul>
        <ul><li>The most useful source is the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RB_zhgQNrXyWiLBS7YQHMM3pTckI0lssYjkq2D5Sag8/edit?usp=sharing">Lecture Notes</a>.</li></ul>

        <ul><li>The biggest challenge for this assignment is to combine CSS with HTML. At first, I could not find the structural matching relationship between the two.
            After reading the notes and reviewing the class records, I found that I had missed a lot of knowledge points.</li></ul>
        <ul><li>I gained a lot in this assignment. I not only wrote a complete CSS document to render HTML, but also inspired many creative ideas from the perspective of personalization. 
            UI design, user interaction effect, logic and so on are my biggest gains.</li></ul>
        <ul><li>I started writing code after reading everything the professor had left us, which made me more efficient.
            In Piazz, I discussed many problems with my peers, which helped me a lot. In particular, Quan's tips helps me a lot.</li></ul>
        <ul><li>I used Google to query RGB in the GIF, which allowed me to accurately restore the target requirements. 
            I also googled the keywords directly to make me aware of the use of code syntax.</li></ul>

        <li><a href="Assignment3/index.html">Assignment3</a></li>
        <ul><li>The most challenging part of this assignment is the complexity of the operation. We can easily understand the relationship between elements and attributes, 
            but it is often difficult to respond to interface interactions.</li></ul>
        <ul><li>After completing this assignment, I learned how to use JS to programmatically combine CSS to render HTML documents. 
            JS is more involved in the interactive operation of users and web pages. Such as input box, selection box, exit, etc.</li></ul>
        <ul><li>The notes provided by the professor are excellent cheat sheets. By reading these documents, I was provided great help for this assignment. 
            At the same time, at Piazz, my peers' questions also inspired me a lot.</li></ul>

        <li><a href="Assignment4/server.js">Assignment4</a></li>
        <ul><li>The biggest challenge was that I had no idea what the instructions were talking about. To solve this problem, I've seen the record video over and over again. 
            It does guide the building blocks of the code, but it's hard to connect the knowledge points together, which leads to zero point.</li></ul>
        <ul><li>In this assignment, I learned how to get global variables, how to set up servers, and how to set up ports.
            And how to link CSS and JS files together to render HTML.</li></ul>
        <ul><li>Piazz's discussion and the TA's office hour have given great inspiration, which makes me finish 
            what is described as a simple assignment before the deadline. haha</li></ul>
        <ul><li>It would have been better if Hess had described the assignment requirements more specifically in the instructions 
            so that we wouldn't be anxious like that and even had some hints will be more relaxed;)</li></ul>
