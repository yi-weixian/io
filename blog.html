        <ul><li>The most challenged one is Git, it is new for me. So I do a lot of search on it.</li></ul>
        <ul><li>In this assignment, I know how to create a good structure with using tags, and I know how to add imagins on the web.</li></ul>
        <ul><li>The most useful source is the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RB_zhgQNrXyWiLBS7YQHMM3pTckI0lssYjkq2D5Sag8/edit?usp=sharing">Lecture Notes</a>.</li></ul>

        <ul><li>The biggest challenge for this assignment is to combine CSS with HTML. At first, I could not find the structural matching relationship between the two.
            After reading the notes and reviewing the class records, I found that I had missed a lot of knowledge points.</li></ul>
        <ul><li>I gained a lot in this assignment. I not only wrote a complete CSS document to render HTML, but also inspired many creative ideas from the perspective of personalization. 
            UI design, user interaction effect, logic and so on are my biggest gains.</li></ul>
        <ul><li>I started writing code after reading everything the professor had left us, which made me more efficient.
            In Piazz, I discussed many problems with my peers, which helped me a lot. In particular, Quan's tips helps me a lot.</li></ul>
        <ul><li>I used Google to query RGB in the GIF, which allowed me to accurately restore the target requirements. 
            I also googled the keywords directly to make me aware of the use of code syntax.</li></ul>
